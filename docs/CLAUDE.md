# Claude Development Workflow for ScaffAI

## üìã Standard Development Flow

This document outlines the standard development workflow for ScaffAI using Claude Code and various MCP tools.

### üîÑ Complete Development Cycle

```
User Instructions/GitHub Issues ‚Üí Todo Creation ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Debugging ‚Üí Verification ‚Üí PR Creation ‚Üí Next Steps
```

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. **Issue Analysis & Todo Creation**
- Analyze user instructions or GitHub issues
- Use `TodoWrite` tool to create structured task breakdown
- Prioritize tasks and mark dependencies
- Set clear acceptance criteria

#### 2. **Implementation Phase**
- Mark todos as `in_progress` one at a time
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns
- Implement features incrementally
- Mark todos as `completed` immediately upon finishing

#### 3. **Testing with Playwright MCP**
- Use `mcp__playwright__*` tools for end-to-end testing
- Take screenshots and snapshots for verification
- Test user flows and interactions
- Verify responsive design across devices

#### 4. **Debugging with Context7 MCP**
- Use `mcp__Context7__resolve-library-id` to identify relevant documentation
- Use `mcp__Context7__get-library-docs` for framework-specific troubleshooting
- Reference official documentation for debugging complex issues
- Apply best practices from library documentation

#### 5. **Re-verification**
- Run final tests after bug fixes
- Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- Check that no regressions were introduced
- Ensure code quality standards

#### 6. **Pull Request Creation**
- Create comprehensive PR with clear description
- Include testing screenshots/videos when applicable
- Reference related issues and todos
- Follow PR template guidelines

#### 7. **Documentation Review & Next Steps**
- Review `@docs` for project context
- Update relevant documentation if needed
- Propose logical next development steps
- Suggest improvements or optimizations

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Tools & Commands

#### Todo Management
```bash
TodoWrite  # Create and update task lists
TodoRead   # Check current task status
```

#### Testing & Verification
```bash
# Playwright MCP commands
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate      # Navigate to pages
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot      # Capture page state
mcp__playwright__browser_click         # Interact with elements
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot # Visual verification
```

#### Documentation & Debugging
```bash
# Context7 MCP commands
mcp__Context7__resolve-library-id      # Find library documentation
mcp__Context7__get-library-docs        # Get specific framework docs
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint        # Code linting
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript validation
npm run test        # Run test suite
```

### üìù Best Practices

#### Todo Management
- Break complex features into 3-5 smaller tasks
- Use clear, actionable descriptions
- Mark only ONE task as `in_progress` at a time
- Complete tasks immediately, don't batch completions

#### Implementation
- Always check existing patterns before writing new code
- Follow project's TypeScript and ESLint configurations
- Write self-documenting code without excessive comments
- Verify dependencies exist before using external libraries

#### Testing Strategy
- Test critical user paths with Playwright
- Verify both mobile and web experiences
- Check offline functionality where applicable
- Test error states and edge cases

#### Documentation
- Keep CLAUDE.md updated with new workflows
- Reference specific file paths and line numbers
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Maintain clear commit messages
- **Update docs/ checkboxes**: Mark checkboxes as completed in relevant docs files (roadmap.md, parallel-development-plan.md) when tasks are finished

#### Component Architecture
- **Maximize component separation**: Break UI into small, focused, reusable components
- Create single-responsibility components with clear interfaces
- Separate business logic from presentation components
- Use composition over inheritance patterns
- Keep components small (< 100 lines when possible)

### üîç Quality Gates

Before marking any feature as complete:
- [ ] All related todos marked as `completed`
- [ ] Playwright tests passing
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No linting violations
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] **docs/ checkboxes updated**: Relevant checkboxes in docs/roadmap.md and docs/parallel-development-plan.md marked as completed

### üöÄ Deployment Checklist

Before creating PR:
- [ ] Feature fully implemented and tested
- [ ] All dependencies properly installed
- [ ] Build process succeeds
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Mobile and web platforms tested
- [ ] Offline functionality verified (if applicable)
